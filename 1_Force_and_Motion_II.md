# Force and Motion II

## 1.1 Resultant Force
A resultant force is the single force that represents the combined effect of two or more forces acting on an object. It is determined by vector addition.
- **Same direction**: Add the magnitudes.
- **Opposite direction**: Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger.
- **Perpendicular forces**: Use Pythagoras' theorem ($F = \\sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2}$) and trigonometry.

## 1.2 Resolution of Forces
A single force can be split (resolved) into two perpendicular components, usually horizontal ($F_x$) and vertical ($F_y$).
- $F_x = F \\cos(\\theta)$
- $F_y = F \\sin(\\theta)$
where $\\theta$ is the angle with the horizontal.

## 1.3 Forces in Equilibrium
An object is in equilibrium when the resultant force acting on it is zero ($F_{net} = 0$). It will either remain at rest or move with a constant velocity.

## 1.4 Elasticity
Elasticity is the property of a material that enables it to return to its original shape and size after the applied force is removed.
- **Hooke's Law**: The extension of a spring is directly proportional to the applied force provided the elastic limit is not exceeded ($F = kx$).
