# Electricity

## 3.1 Current and Potential Difference
**Current** ($I$) is the rate of flow of electric charge($Q$) through a conductor.
Formula: $I = Q / t$. The SI unit is Ampere (A).

**Potential Difference** ($V$) between two points is the work done ($W$) in moving one coulomb of charge from one point to another.
Formula: $V = W / Q$. The SI unit is Volt (V).

## 3.2 Resistance
**Resistance** ($R$) is a measure of the opposition to the flow of electric current in a circuit.
Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided the physical conditions are constant.
Formula: $V = IR$.

Components of resistance: length, cross-sectional area, material type, and temperature ($R = \\rho l / A$).

## 3.3 Electromotive Force and Internal Resistance
**Electromotive Force (e.m.f, $E$)** is the energy provided per unit charge by a source (like a battery).
**Internal Resistance ($r$)** is the resistance against moving current inside the source itself.
Formula: $E = I(R + r)$ or $E = V + Ir$, where $V$ is the terminal potential difference.

## 3.4 Electrical Energy and Power
**Electrical Energy ($E$)** is the work done by the electrical source to drive current through an electrical component.
Formula: $E = VIt$ or $E = I^2Rt$ or $E = V^2t / R$.

**Electrical Power ($P$)** is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or dissipated.
Formula: $P = E / t = VI = I^2R = V^2 / R$.
