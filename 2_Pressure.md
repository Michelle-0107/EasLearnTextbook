# Pressure

## 2.1 Pressure in Liquids
The pressure in a liquid ($P$) increases with depth ($h$), density of the liquid ($\\rho$), and gravitational field strength ($g$).
Formula: $P = h \\rho g$
Pressure acts in all directions and is independent of the shape of the container.

## 2.2 Atmospheric Pressure
Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air in Earth's atmosphere. It acts on everything on Earth's surface and decreases with altitude.
Measured using a mercury barometer or an aneroid barometer. Standard atmospheric pressure ($P_{atm}$) is $1.01 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}$.

## 2.3 Gas Pressure
Gas pressure is caused by the continuous collisions of gas molecules against the walls of their container. It can be measured using a manometer or a Bourdon gauge.
Kinetic theory of gases explains how gas pressure arises due to the change in momentum of particles upon collision.

## 2.4 Pascal's Principle
Pascal's Principle states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted uniformly in all directions throughout the fluid.
- **Application**: Hydraulic systems, hydraulic brakes.
- $F_1 / A_1 = F_2 / A_2$

## 2.5 Archimedes' Principle
Archimedes' Principle states that a body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.
- **Buoyant Force** ($F_B$) = Weight of fluid displaced ($W_{fluid}$) = $\\rho V g$.
- If $F_B > W_{object}$, it floats. Otherwise, it sinks.

## 2.6 Bernoulli's Principle
Bernoulli's Principle states that as the speed of a moving fluid (liquid or gas) increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases.
- **Application**: Aerofoil lift, bunsen burner, carburetor.
