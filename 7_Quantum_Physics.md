## 7.1 Quantum Theory of Light
Classical physics considers light as an electromagnetic wave. Quantum physics considers light as discrete packets of energy called **photons**.
A photon carries a quantum of energy, which is proportional to its frequency ($f$).
Formula: **$E = hf$**, where $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}$).

## 7.2 Photoelectric Effect
The emission of electrons from a metal surface when light of a specific high frequency shines on it.
- **Characteristics**: Only occurs if the incident light frequency is above the **threshold frequency ($f_0$)** of the metal.
- The kinetic energy of emitted electrons depends on the frequency of light, not its intensity.
- This effect provides strong evidence for the particle nature of light.

## 7.3 Einstein's Photoelectric Equation
Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by applying Planck's quantum theory.
He stated that the energy of the incident photon ($E = hf$) is used entirely to:
1. Break the electron free from the metal (Work Function, $W$).
2. Give kinetic energy ($K_{max}$) to the escaping electron.

Formula: **$hf = W + K_{max}$**
Where Work Function $W = hf_0$.
This means an electron will only be emitted if the incident frequency $f$ is greater than the threshold frequency $f_0$.
