## 4.1 Force on a Current-carrying Conductor in a Magnetic Field
A force acts on a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field. This is known as the motor effect.
**Fleming's Left-Hand Rule** is used to determine the direction of the force:
- Thumb: Direction of Force (Motion)
- Index finger: Direction of Magnetic Field (N to S)
- Middle finger: Direction of Current (+ to -)
The force is maximum when the conductor is perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is zero when the conductor is parallel to the magnetic field.

## 4.2 Electromagnetic Induction
Electromagnetic induction is the phenomenon of producing an induced electromotive force (e.m.f) in a conductor when there is a change in the magnetic flux linkage.
- **Faraday's Law**: The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage.
- **Lenz's Law**: The direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change producing it.
- **Fleming's Right-Hand Rule** is used for generators to find the direction of the induced current.

## 4.3 Transformer
A transformer is a device used to increase or decrease the alternating voltage (a.c.) based on the principle of electromagnetic induction.
It consists of primary and secondary coils wound on a soft iron core.
- **Step-up Transformer**: Increases voltage ($N_s > N_p$).
- **Step-down Transformer**: Decreases voltage ($N_s < N_p$).
- Transformer Equation: $V_s / V_p = N_s / N_p$ where $V$ is voltage and $N$ is number of turns.
Ideal transformer assumes 100% efficiency: $P_p = P_s = V_p I_p = V_s I_s$.
