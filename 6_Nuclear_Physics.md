## 6.1 Radioactive Decay
**Radioactivity** is the spontaneous disintegration of an unstable nucleus to form a more stable nucleus by emitting energetic particles or photons.
The three main types of radiation:
- **Alpha ($\\alpha$)**: A helium nucleus ($^4_2\\text{He}$). Low penetration power, stopped by paper. High ionizing power.
- **Beta ($\\beta$)**: A fast-moving electron ($^0_{-1}\\text{e}$). Moderate penetration power, stopped by a few mm of aluminium. Medium ionizing power.
- **Gamma ($\\gamma$)**: High-frequency electromagnetic wave. High penetration power, reduced by thick lead or concrete. Low ionizing power.

**Half-life ($T_{1/2}$)**: The time taken for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.
Calculated using $N = N_0 (1/2)^n$, where $n = t / T_{1/2}$.

## 6.2 Nuclear Energy
**Nuclear Fission**: The splitting of a heavy, unstable nucleus into two lighter, more stable nuclei, accompanied by the release of a large amount of energy and neutrons.
Example: Uranium-235 hit by a neutron.

**Nuclear Fusion**: The combining of two light nuclei to form a heavier, more stable nucleus with the release of a tremendous amount of energy.
Example: Two hydrogen nuclei fusing to form helium (like in the Sun). Requires extremely high temperatures and pressure.

**Mass Defect and Energy**: Both processes release energy due to a loss in mass (mass defect).
Formula: $E = mc^2$, where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass defect, and $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).
