# Electronics

## 5.1 Electron
**Thermionic Emission**: The release of electrons from the surface of a heated metal.
A cathode ray is a fast-moving beam of electrons moving through a vacuum in a straight line.
Properties of cathode rays:
- Negatively charged particles (electrons)
- Deflected by electric and magnetic fields
- Possess kinetic energy and momentum
- Can cause fluorescence

## 5.2 Semiconductor Diode
A semiconductor diode is a component made up of p-type and n-type semiconductors combined together to allow current to flow in one direction only.
- **Forward Bias**: Allow current to flow when the positive terminal of a battery is connected to the p-type (anode) and negative to the n-type (cathode).
- **Reverse Bias**: Prevent current from flowing when connected the opposite way.
- **Rectification**: The conversion of alternating current (a.c.) to direct current (d.c.) using diodes. Can be half-wave or full-wave rectification.

## 5.3 Transistor
A transistor consists of three layers of doped semiconductors, forming either an $npn$ or a $pnp$ transistor.
Key terminals:
- Base (B): Triggers the transistor operation.
- Collector (C): Carries the amplified current.
- Emitter (E): Where electron emission begins or ends.
Main functions of a transistor:
1. **As an amplifier**: Amplifies a small change in base current into a large change in collector current.
2. **As an automatic switch**: Turns on or off a circuit depending on the input logic or resistance changes.
